Alive
#####

The Alive Interface provides a basic watchdog functionality interface that delivers essential monitoring capabilities for system health and responsiveness tracking.
It implements core watchdog operations including heartbeat signals to ensure reliable operation and automatic recovery from unresponsive states.

**SCORE Application Liveliness Reporting**

SCORE applications can periodically signal their liveliness to the :term:`Launch Manager` through the Alive Interface. This mechanism allows the :term:`Launch Manager` to:

- Detect application failures or hangs
- Trigger recovery actions when liveliness is lost
- Maintain accurate process health status

The liveliness mechanism includes:

- Configurable heartbeat intervals per application
- Timeout detection and failure handling

Interface

The alive interface is defined here: :need:`logic_arc_int__lifecycle__alive_if`
