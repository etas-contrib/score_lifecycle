/// @details A ProcessInfoNode is a node in the dependency graph that represents an OS process and its associated
/// component. It manages the lifecycle of the process, including activation, deactivation, and state reporting. The
/// node tracks the process's PID, status, and state, and provides methods to activate or deactivate the process, as
/// well as to report its completion or error state. At the same time it implements the IComponent interface, allowing
/// it to be treated as a component in the graph's transition engine.
/// @note A Component and a Process have distinct state machines. The component may be in kActive state while the
/// process is in kTerminated state, for example, if the process self-terminates after reaching its ready condition.
